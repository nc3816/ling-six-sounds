# Ling Six Sounds Check Online Test

## Project Overview
The **Ling Six Sounds Check Online Test** is an interactive online tool designed to assess and enhance users' ability to recognize and distinguish a range of speech frequencies. Based on the six Ling sounds ("ah", "ee", "oo", "sh", "s", and "mm"), this tool helps users train and evaluate their auditory skills across low to high frequency speech ranges.

## Features
1. **Practice Mode**:
   - **Manual Mode**: Users can click buttons to play each sound individually.
   - **Loop Mode**: The system randomly plays sounds for users to practice.

2. **Test Mode**:
   - **Multiple Choice Test**: Users listen to a sound and choose the correct one. Options include customizable number of choices, questions, and allowed replays.
   - **Same or Different Test**: The system plays two sounds, and users decide whether they are the same or different.

3. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Responsive design for all devices.
   - Interactive feedback, such as replay prompts and test result analysis.
   - Dark theme for eye protection.
